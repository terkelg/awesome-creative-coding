> Carefully curated list of awesome [creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding) resources primarily for beginners/intermediates.

Creative coding is a different discipline than programming systems. The goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. **Interaction design**, **information visualization** and **generative art** are all different types of creative coding – which has become a household term describing **artworks articulated as code**.
